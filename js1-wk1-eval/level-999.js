// Without running code,
// predict and explain what will get logged to the console for each line below
// think carefully about the difference between each line
// write down your predictions
// Look up documentation for Math.abs if you've not used it before

console.log(Math.abs);
// This will  log just the function definition of Math.abs
console.log(Math.abs());
//This will log UNDEFINED because no argument is passed to Math.abs
console.log(Math.abs(-100));
//This will log 100 because Math.abs returns the absolute value of -100
